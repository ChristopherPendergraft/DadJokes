This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app).

I used the React Router V4 to manage route changes. The http requests use axios. Dead simple and no need for Redux, I may have use that if this was part of a larger system, or if more state management was needed. For CSS I used Flex. 

React Router V4 is a rethink on React as a full stack solution. Middle ware no longer requires a Express layer.
